            <p>I'm a full-time developer for the Department of Defense and in my free time I explore ideas I'm interested in or try to learn new skills. The idea of this website is to see how far I can push traditional LEMP-style stack.</p>

            <div class="intro">
                <p>Many of the projects I'm interested in are focused on empowering individuals and decentralization. I'm also hoping to use these projects as learning experiences for developing reliable, tested software.</p>

                <li>Grounded News</li>
                <p>Named riffed from "Ground News". The idea is to create a FOSS app for android that could bring together multiple news or blog feeds and automatically parse them together and present them to the user based on highly customizable parameters. Would likely support RSS feeds, but may support Nostr or AT protocol feeds later on.</p>
                <li>Owntracks 360</li>
                <p>Fork of <a href="https://github.com/owntracks">Owntracks</a> designed specifically for personal safety with a more user-friendly interface similar to life360 and added offline features that can be used to protect users.</p>
                <li>automated pipeline testing</li>
                <p>open-source automated pipeline QA and pen-testing to protect smaller developers from being compromised upon launch</p>
                <li>OCSource</li>
                <p>A centralized tool that uses vectorized image recognition techniques to trace the origins of photos used on websites or video freeze-frames to combat misinformation and content theft.</p>
